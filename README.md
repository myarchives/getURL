getURL
======

perl script that takes 3 arguments: (1) url to search (2) search term in the href link you want to grab and (3) the target file extension you want to link saved as without a dot, i.e., "mp4", "txt", "pdf", "jpeg",... The script will then go throuh the html looking for said tags and download them appending the appropriate file extension.
